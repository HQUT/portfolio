### Snake Game: A Basic Arcade Experience on ChipKIT UNO32

Designed and implemented a basic version of the classic Snake game using **C programming** and translated it into **MIPS assembly** for execution on a **ChipKIT UNO32**. The game runs on an embedded screen with controls for the snake's movement through buttons on the I/O board. The goal is to eat fruit and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake’s own body. Extensive testing ensured smooth functionality and gameplay. This project provided hands-on experience in embedded system design and assembly programming.
