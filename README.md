## An Engineer with a Passion for Technology and Innovation
My name is Hiba, and I’m on an exciting journey as an engineer in information technology, pursuing a master’s degree in Data Science. How did I get here? It’s a question many people ask—and one I’ve reflected on myself throughout my journey. Let me share my story with you, and you’ll see why technology is not just my future but also my passion.

My love for technology began early, as a child. Back then, technology wasn’t as advanced as it is today—we’re talking about TVs, CDs, and the classic Nokia phones with the Snake game. I was fascinated by how it all worked: How could moving images appear on a screen? Where did the pictures come from? How does it all work together? I was curious and fearless—I pressed every button on the remote control and clicked around the internet (which resulted in an impressive number of unused accounts on various websites!).

Then, a major turning point in my life happened: at the age of 14, I moved to Sweden. It was a completely new world for me, and I had to start over. But this is where my real journey began. I became fluent in Swedish within just eight months, but I didn’t stop there. I picked up Kurdish to communicate with family and learned Turkish by binge-watching TV series. It was then I realized I had a knack for learning languages quickly—and thought: If I can learn human languages, I can surely learn computer languages too!

In high school and during my technical preparatory year, I truly found my direction. I discovered a love for mathematics—hours would fly by as I solved problems. This was when my fascination with practical and logical challenges took off. I wanted to understand the world, solve problems, and explore the unknown.

It became clear that technology wasn’t just a hobby for me—it was my passion. Today, as I dive deeper into subjects like machine learning, robotics, and AI, I know I’ve found my calling. My goal is to contribute to technological advancements, create solutions that change the world, and continuously push the boundaries of what’s possible.

Here I stand now, filled with motivation and an unwavering drive. I’m ready to take on challenges, grow as an engineer, and contribute to the future of technology. Want to join me on this journey? Let’s create something amazing together!

**Conducted a pilot study on learning through confusion in Human-Robot Interaction using the Furhat robot.** Designed and implemented an experimental framework to explore how different levels of confusion (no confusion, productive confusion, and unproductive confusion) impact learning and engagement. Participants interacted with the robot in an AI tutoring session where confusion was strategically induced through varying levels of information. Data collection included self-reported feedback, observer ratings, and performance metrics. The study demonstrated that **productively managed confusion enhances engagement and learning**, contributing insights to the development of adaptive educational robots.

#### Snake Game: A Basic Arcade Experience on ChipKIT UNO32

Designed and implemented a basic version of the classic Snake game using **C programming** and translated it into **MIPS assembly** for execution on a **ChipKIT UNO32**. The game runs on an embedded screen with controls for the snake's movement through buttons on the I/O board. The goal is to eat fruit and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake’s own body. Extensive testing ensured smooth functionality and gameplay. This project provided hands-on experience in embedded system design and assembly programming.
